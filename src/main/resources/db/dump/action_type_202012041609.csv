Dear Sir or Madam,

Despite several reminders, your company has not paid yet the following invoices that are past due {overdue_invoice_reference_list} and that you will find attached to this letter.

We therefore demand that you proceed to the payment of {customer_outstanding_amount} within the next 15 days. Otherwise, we would have to take the matter in front of the proper jurisdiction and ask for compensation for our financial loss.

We look forward to hearing from you,

Regards""
